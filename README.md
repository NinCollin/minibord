# minibord
A minimalistic PHP/MySQL anonymous bulletin-board thingy mostly worked on at night. Code may be messy due to lack of sleep.

It's a very basic, table-based layout, but it works. It supports posting topics, posting replies, and has built-in RSS support.

## installing
It needs some version of PHP (tested on 7, should work on 8) and a MySQL or MariaDB server.

* Create a new MySQL database
* Import the minibord.sql file to this database
* Edit core.php with your MySQL login details
* Make some mini posts
