# minibord
A minimalistic PHP/MySQL anonymous bulletin-board thingy mostly worked on at night

It's a very basic, unthemed, table-based layout, but it works. It supports posting topics, posting replies, and has built-in RSS support

## installing
It needs some version of PHP (tested on 7, should work on 8) and a MySQL or MariaDB server.
Create a new MySQL database, import the minibord.sql file, and edit core.php with your MySQL login details

## demo
You can view a live demo of it at https://board.rainynight.city
